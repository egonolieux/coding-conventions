# Issue tracking

## Title and description

- Prefer writing the title in the imperative mood. If not possible, use a descriptive sentence.
- Keep the title as short as possible for better readability.
- Use proper capitalization.
- Do not end the title with a period.
- Do not add a description if the title is self explanatory.

## Labels

When it comes to issue tracking, there are 5 categories of labels:

1. The type of the issue, prefixed by `Type`.
2. The status of the issue, prefixed by `Status`.
3. The priority of the issue, prefixed by `Priority`.
4. Additional information about the issue, prefixed by `Info`.
5. The topic of the issue, no prefix.

Type, status and priority labels **must only be used once** per issue.
