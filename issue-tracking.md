# Issue tracking

When it comes to issue tracking, there are 5 categories of labels:

1. The type of the issue, prefixed by `Type`.
2. The status of the issue, prefixed by `Status`.
3. The priority of the issue, prefixed by `Priority`.
4. Additional information about the issue, prefixed by `Info`.
5. The topic of the issue, no prefix.

Type, status and priority labels **must only be used once** per issue.
